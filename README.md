# StackOverflowAnalytics
Using stack overflow Q/A data to perform feature analysis in the field of Computer Science

[Dataset Used](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stacksample)

[Reduction & Cleaning](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TarunSunkaraneni/StackOverflowAnalytics/blob/master/Notebook/reduction_and_cleaning.ipynb): In this notebook I had to pre-process all questions and answers asked by people, and determine which questions can be deemed relevant. Finally, a cleaned, new dataset which only contains relevant questions is used.
